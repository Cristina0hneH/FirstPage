 <p>This video is from Youtube and I had to use iframe for it. Just copy it from the "embed" section in the share menu. Iframe and other tags (meter, button, progress, map, bdo etc) need "more" to work. And bu "more"I mean JS, CSS etc. It basically allows you to open a web page inside of your web page</p>
<meter min="40" max="100" value="80"></meter>
